      <p>Originally from Beirut, Lebanon, I recently graduated from <span><a href="https://www.lewagon.com/dubai" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none">Le Wagon</a></span>, the leading Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.</p>
      <p>I have 8 years of experience working at ad agencies such as Leo Burnett and Publicis ME and with clients such as Nestle, P&G, Mondelez and Arla.</p>
     <p>With my passion for creativity and problem-solving, I found that learning to code and moving into tech was a perfect next step in my journey.</p>
